# Git Guide
Git is powerful and commonly used software tool for managing version history of files, espically ASCII based files e.g. the files of OpenFAST. 

### What do you need to know first?
1. If you read these instructions before starting you work in this repository (this how an folder is called that is managed by git) you should have an basic understanding of what you can do, what you can't and what you shouldn't do. 
2. If you want to just read files and browse through everything you can stop reading here. This is possible without any login or such thing. You can even download files if you want to. If this is not the case go to the next point.
3. First you need to create a GitHub Account. Go to the [GitHub](https://github.com/) website and create yourself an Account. Please add your full name to the profile in your account for the duration you are participating in the Optimus project. A little manual on how to that you can find [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile). You can change this back after the project is done. This is just so we can easier identify the people. 
4. After you GitHub Account is ready to use you can send your account name to Julius, Felix or Soni. We than grand you writing permissions to the project.
5. Before you now start working on the Optimus GitHub Project files you should do these two tutorials.
First do the [general tutorial(https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)] for git and play a little bit around with the stuff you learned there.
Second do the tutorial for the [GitHub desktop app](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
